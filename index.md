# What is the causal map app?

It's a new online research tool, a way to code, analyse and visualise fragments of information about what causes what.

- social science researchers and students use it to make sense of what interviewees tell them

- programme evaluators use it to visualise stakeholders' claims about how a programme works and create collective "theories of change"

# How much will it cost?

You'll be able to make and edit your own causal maps for free -- with some restrictions. If you want extra toppings, like private projects, there'll probably be a monthly subscription.

# How does the causal map app differ from other software?

You use Dedoose or Nvivo to tag, organise and understand the information from interviewees or other sources. 

You use Kumu.io or Visio or Powerpoint to construct and present information about a network.

You use the `causal map app` to organise, understand and present information about "what causes what", from interviewees or other sources, as a causal network. Nvivo can't do that. Kumu.io can't do that. We know of no other software which can do that!

With the causal map app, you can:

- **view narrative data**, e.g. from different interviewees 
- **highlight causal claims**, like using a highlighter pen, and associate them with links between items: the two ore more things which cause one another, according to this interviewee
- automatically combine & display the multiple claims as a **causal map**,
- **filter** the claims according to source, e.g. show only claims from women
- **colour-code** the claims according to source

# What problems can the causal map app help solve?

## Social research

When people talk and write, they often give us rich information about what they think causes what. Students and researchers want to extract this rich information from texts e.g. interview transcripts. They can use the causal map app to identify and highlight this information about what causes what, within the text.

## Programme evaluation

Professional evaluators and programme staff collect stories of change from stakeholders on the ground; they can use the causal map app to understand, aggregate and present these testimonies.

# Theoretical background

The causal map app is a sister of the QuIP methodology. Here's a [free book about QuIP](https://www.developmentbookshelf.com/doi/book/10.3362/9781780447469).
