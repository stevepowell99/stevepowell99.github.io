# What is the causal map app?

It's a new online research tool, a way to code, analyse and visualise fragments of information about what causes what.

- social science researchers and students use it to make sense of what interviewees tell them

- programme evaluators use it to visualise stakeholders' claims about how a programme works and create collective "theories of change"

# How much will it cost?

You'll be able to make and edit your own causal maps for free -- with some restrictions. If you want extra toppings, like private projects, there'll probably be a monthly subscription.

# How does the causal map app differ from other software?

You use Dedoose or Nvivo to tag, organise and understand the information from interviewees or other sources. 

You use Kumu.io or Visio or Powerpoint to construct and present information about a network.

You use the `causal map app` to organise, understand and present information about "what causes what", from interviewees or other sources, as a causal network. Nvivo can't do that. Kumu.io can't do that. We know of no other software which can do that!

With the causal map app, you can:

- **view narrative data**, e.g. from different interviewees 
- **highlight causal claims**, like using a highlighter pen, and associate them with links between items: the two ore more things which cause one another, according to this interviewee
- automatically combine & display the multiple claims as a **causal map**,
- **filter** the claims according to source, e.g. show only claims from women
- **colour-code** the claims according to source

# What problems can the causal map app help solve?

## Social research

When people talk and write, they often give us rich information about what they think causes what. Students and researchers want to extract this rich information from texts e.g. interview transcripts. They can use the causal map app to identify and highlight this information about what causes what, within the text.

## Programme evaluation

Professional evaluators and programme staff collect stories of change from stakeholders on the ground; they can use the causal map app to understand, aggregate and present these testimonies.

# Theoretical background

The causal map app is a sister of the QuIP methodology. Here's a [free book about QuIP](https://www.developmentbookshelf.com/doi/book/10.3362/9781780447469). 

## But isn't causation a bit of a taboo? 

Gone are the days when we could think of data or information as primarily about *numbers*. Many of us who are involved in understanding the social world and evaluating interventions within it spend much of our day understanding, presenting, manipulating and caring about *causal structures* (and even *models of other people’s* causal structures). 


The fundamental, radical points are these:

- **Causal information is primary information**. It isn't something which exists only virtually as a potential conclusion on the basis of observations of non-causal variables. There is a fact of the matter about what causes what, just as there is a fact of the matter about the number of people on a training course.
- Parallel to that, **humans' perception of causation is primary**, as primary (and fallible) as our perception, say, of colour. All the things which we know, or think we know, about our world -- from the [colour of that dress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress) to the way the wind shakes the trees -- have already been through a lot of cognitive processing, and none of it is "secondary". So when we ask stakeholders the "why question" (what causes what in this domain), we are not asking them, first and foremost, about what they deduce from their (non-causal) observations in the way we might as scientists or researchers. That would be a very shaky method; we might be better just to ask them to tell us about their non-causal observations and we could try deducing causality themselves. No, we are asking them about what causes what based on their underlying understanding of the causal structure of their world, which they have pieced together in a number of different ways. 


The causal map app helps you work directly with stakeholders' causal claims rather than, say, looking for correlations between variables. Stakeholders' causal claims are of course very far from being infallible sources of information about how their part of the world really works; but at least they probably know a lot more than "we the scientists" do. In any case, their causal claims are valuable information in their own right: often it is important to know what stakeholders *believe*, regardless of whether it is true.



As James Copestake [@copestake2019attributing] says: 

> "..… attribution claims underpinning the QuIP do not require a control group, nor indeed variation in exposure to the intervention across the sample of respondents interviewed. Rather, causal claims rely on the integrity of ‘within-case’ statements made by respondents themselves". 

## So what is a causal map?



## So what is a causal multi-map?
