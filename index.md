# What is the causal map app?

It's a new online research tool, a way to code, analyse and visualise fragments of information about what causes what.

- social science researchers use it to make sense of what interviewees tell them

- programme evaluators use it to visualise stakeholders' claims about how a programme works and create collective "theories of change"

# What is the theory behind it?



## How does the causal map app differ from other software?

- **view narrative data**, e.g. from different interviewees 
- **highlight causal claims** like using a highlighter pen
- automatically combine & display the claims as a **causal map**,
- **filter** the claims according to source, e.g. show only claims from women
- **colour-code** the claims according to source
