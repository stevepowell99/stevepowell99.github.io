## How does the causal map app differ from other software?

- **view narrative data**, e.g. from different interviewees 
- **highlight causal claims** like using a highlighter pen
- automatically combine & display the claims as a **causal map**,
- **filter** the claims according to source, e.g. show only claims from women
- **colour-code** the claims according to source
